# taxcalc

A Python script for calculating total income tax for 2024 for Ireland,
Scotland, England, Wales, and Singapore.

Tax bands and allowances are for 2024 from the respective government
websites.

I wrote this while considering job offers, etc., to see what the
impact of taxation might be. Some information is specific to me
(e.g. the tax credits claimed in Ireland) and would be different for
other people.

Adding support for another country/state should be fairly easy. It's
abstracted enough to enable extension, but not so much that it becomes
a nightmare of complexity.
